This report is a quick overview of the work that has been completed, as well as where the group plans to apply these efforts.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Cleaning}: With multiple data sources within the repository we identified as our dataset for this project, a natural step before conducting any analysis and/or modeling is to clean and preprocess the data. 

    This task has proved arduous with thousands of school names across the United States, hundreds of which have alternative names, have \textit{changed} names, or have different naming conventions between the two datasets. This has culminated in a laborious effort to identify and \textit{hand-change} school names so that joining the datasets together introduces no unnecessary rows (i.e., NA values).  
    \item \textbf{Exploratory Data Analysis}: Given that we could identify \textit{multiple} response variables to model in explaining our research question, our EDA has been targeted at familiarizing ourselves with the data and identifying surprising [linear] associations. 
    \item \textbf{Identification of New Modeling Techniques}: Rather than simply \textit{re}-applying regression techniques from a Bayesian paradigm, we floated the possibility of tree-based methods (e.g., \textbf{Bayesian Additive Regression Trees} (BART), classification/regression trees, etc.) as a new modeling technique. Once the data cleaning is \textit{complete} (which it would be at the deadline of this report), group discussions will certainly pin down which of these techniques is finalized. Separately, \textit{regression splines} were an idea we hypothesized, including methods like \textbf{Multivariate additive regression spline} (MARS). \textit{The working plan for modeling is to fit a plethora of models and identify those which are performative, parsimonous, and as interpretable as possible}! 
\end{enumerate}
We hypothesize exploring questions related to \textit{graduation rate} (variable name \textit{PooledC150}) and early/mid/late career pay.
